## The differece between var, let and const

var - a variable that is initialized globally with the default value of undefined. 

> **const** and **let** are block scope variables. This means they are only defined in the block they are declared in. 

const - is read only and cannot be re-defined

let - is read/write and cannot be used before being defined. It can be re-defined but is not initialized as undefined.
